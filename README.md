# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Scripts

In this project, a NLP pipeline was created in order to pre-process textual data manifesting in the form of movie scripts. Feature extraction
is performed after pre-processing, followed by sentiment analysis using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance Lexicon created by Saif M. Mohamed.
The move scripts can be found in the following drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1taQWauLwMIgceNUBZaOSzPjEyQMkOXQe/view?usp=sharing
